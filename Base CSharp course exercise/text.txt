Dog carcass in alley this morning, tire tread on burst stomach.  
This city is afraid of me.  I have seen it's true face.  
The streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood and when the drains finally scab over, all the vermin will drown.
The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout "Save us!"...
